# Version control
### What is it, and why do we need it?

**Version Control** is a system to reliably **manage a project’s codebase**, allowing for multiple people to **collaborate** it at the same time, keeping a **history** of all the changes the code is subject to.

### Benefits
- Stores the whole codebase in one organised place
- Allows for multiple people to work on the same code, **at the same time**
- Keeps a full history of the entire codebase
- Allows for separate branching (as we’ll see later) for individual features
- Allows to roll-back any change at ease
