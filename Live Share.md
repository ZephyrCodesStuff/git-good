- Install it

> ⚠️ If you can’t find the extension, **you might be using a FOSS version of Visual Studio Code**, such as `VSCodium`.\
\
Live Share **does not exist** on such versions, for legal reasons, as it is Microsoft proprietary software and FOSS versions of Code **purposely** strip all proprietary code out.

- Start a new session by clicking the `Live Share` button
