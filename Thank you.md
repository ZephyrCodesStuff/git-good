# ✨ Thank you, developers!
With this “little” introduction, hopefully you’re now going to be able to:
- Create your own repositories
- Contribute to other people’s repositories
- Manage your codebase **safely** and **efficiently**
> Hopefully without nuking too many repos at the beginning

### Any questions? Help needed?
You can always contact me on:
- **Telegram**: `@zephyrflac`
- **Discord**: `zephyr.flac`
- **E-mail**: `zeph@zephs.me`
	- I cannot reply from this e-mail address, but I will read and use another one to reply. Blame DigitalOcean.

✨ **Thank you for your attention, and happy coding!**
