# Pull request
### What is a Pull Request (“PR”)?
> ⚠️ **Corpo alert**: you’ll (hopefully) never find yourself working in a company that doesn’t use these.

A PR (shorthand for Pull Request), is a **request to merge** a branch into another one.
> Usually, this would be **merging a secondary branch** (like a `fix` or a `feat` branch) **into the `main` branch**.

PRs allow other developers to **check out the updates** brought into `main`, and to optionally **approve or deny** these, adding comments where they can explain what should be changed.

### How do I create one?
After you’ve **pushed your commit/s** to a branch, you should:
1. **Go on GitHub**, on the repository’s home page
2. **Switch** to your branch
3. GitHub will alert you if you can create a **PR**

#### What if `main` is ahead?
In case `main` is **ahead** (and your branch is behind), GitHub will tell you there’s nothing to merge.
