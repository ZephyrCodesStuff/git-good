# Organization
### How does an “org” work?
An “**org**”, shorthand for “**organisation**”, is an entity specific to GitHub. It allows for multiple people to share repositories and work on them.

An **organisation** can optionally contain **teams** of specific people (such as a “software” team or a “firmware” team), and those people’s access can be restricted to their specific repositories, or be given access to all of the organisation’s repositories (our case).

### GitHub Projects
GitHub Projects are a feature specific to GitHub, that allows teams to efficiently keep track of progress.

The work needed is split into Tasks, and each Task is assigned to a person  (or a group of people) that will work on it.

Each Task has:
- A **priority**
	- Low
	- Medium
	- High
	- Critical
- A **complexity**, expressed in **story points**
	- Usually, story points follow the Fibonacci sequence: \\(1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13\\).
- One or more **tags**
	- Examples: `feature`, `bug-fix`, `documentation`, etc...
