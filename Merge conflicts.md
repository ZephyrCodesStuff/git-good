# Merge conflicts
If two developers work on the same feature at the same time, you may end up with **the same file modified in two different ways**.

This is called a **merge conflict**. To solve them, we have to:
1. Go over the individual conflicting files
2. Manually pick which changes we want to keep and which ones to discard
3. Finalise the merge conflict and merge, then push the merge commit.

> âœ¨ Code editors like **Visual Studio Code** make fixing merge conflicts much easier, providing you a GUI to pick the changes from.
